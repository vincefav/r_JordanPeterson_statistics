I've seen good discussions on those but 65% (rough estimate) of submissions right now is about how stupid the alt-left or post-modern-Marxist are. I'm not saying we shouldn't talk about politics. I'm advocating we talk about it in a more constructive and productive way. In a manner which will help us as we enter the belly of the beast and come out of it as a hero.
I think its best if we have a schedule on which days we post about politics or psychology/life related issues and up the content of the post.

Thanks for using for feedbacks and hope we can make a better subreddit",

That is undeniably a good thing, in that it may provide a mechanism to progress towards truth. 

That said, I tend to get really tired of low effort outrage-bait posts (ie: infowars BS, anti-PC circlejerking, etc..) and find many commenters are expressing some VERY unambiguous identitarian (read racist) ideological rhetoric. Some posts seem to be comprised of purely ideological puppets spouting pure ideologically programmed gibberish without any discernible human mind alive behind the keyboard. These types of commenters don't seem to reflect any prior exposure to JBP, appearing to be alt-right moths drawn to something bright in order to spread their ideological payload. 

Basically, in a sub inspired by an academic that's railed about the dangers of ideological possession and the great benefit of reasonable discussions across the political and personality aisle, it seems counterproductive to not do anything about ideologically possessed weasels in our chicken coop. If nothing is done, don't be surprised when all our eggs (potential) are spoiled, broken, and devoured as we sleep. 

I believe the core of the sub can hold its own against any reasonable (and most unreasonable) critiques from the left (especially since there are more than a few of us progressives in here), but I think fighting off ideological zombies from the right (and often appearing to come from inside) is a much more difficult task. And doing both at once may break the community - I suspect the outcome will be the flight of moderates and the loss of any credibility as the sub is subsumed 
from the far right. 


Potential solutions: sortable/filterable tags for off-topic and political circlejerking posts, limits on account age (3-7day min), and even some bans (without content removal to maintain transparency). 

TLDR: More and better modding of far-right/alt-right/racist users MAY prevent an exodus and allow the sub to better articulate its views to itself and to useful critics. 
","Better political breakdown (2D fiscal/social right/left), additional philosophical questions (metaphysical views: monism, dualism, nature of consciousness; ethics: utilitarian, aristotelian(virtue), etc.; epistemological: pragmatic, objective/scientific).  Opinion on institutions: academia (social and hard science), NA/EU governments/parties, media/press (traditional- newspapers and wire, infotainment- aka cable news and maybe things like buzzfeed, citizen journalism - youtube and other sources)

IMPORTANT: How many hours of JP has a user watched? What topics do you find most engaging? (ex: clinical psychology, biblical/archetypical analyses, interviews/political commentary) "
